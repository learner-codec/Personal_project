# 🌸 PinkGPT

Welcome to **PinkGPT** — a streamlined web interface for interacting with GPT-4 using OpenAI's API. This project offers a local instance of GPT-4 with added functionality for document summarization, conversational continuity, and chat history recall.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Document Summarization:** Quickly summarize text documents.
- **End-to-End Conversations:** Maintain context within each session.
- **Chat History Recall:** Access previous messages during chats for context retention. *(Note: With larger histories, response behavior may vary due to limited context size. Tested up to 4096 tokens.)*
